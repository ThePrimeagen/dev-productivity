what's left ai yeah this thing's the devil i am going to use github copilot to write a cli based game in golang now i do not know how to read a character from standard in when it comes to golang i don't really remember the syntax for a struct and golang i don't really remember any of the things about go i would have to look up a few things instead i'm going to let co-pilot write the whole thing for me and yes i do have to use vscode okay i don't want to use vscode okay github copilot's not available for a superior editing experience but i just have to use vscode okay i am forced so the reason why i didn't want to do like a data structure or something is cause you could just look that up i wanted something that's a little bit more free form so you can just see how powerful github copilot actually is to get started we need the cedar program with some comments for github's copilot to kind of know where we're going how about this one create a game that will pick a number randomly randomly between 1 and 100 and ask the user to guess the number okay that seems good two users to guess uh to guess the number whoever let's see how let's see what they have to say if the user the guest is number oh no whoever guesses the number guesses the number closest to the random number wins there we go okay there we go we've done the whole thing input comes from the s from the terminal oh perfect all right oh i like that and output goes to the terminal all right so let's get started i think what we need to do is start with a type of some sort right skype player struct yup yup yeah all right what else do we need we probably need a game right to type uh i'm sorry whoa let co-pilot take the wheel all right game struck we're gonna have a player one okay i'll take this we're gonna have a player too okay i mean i guess random in yeah that sounds good okay let's do it that seems pretty good right okay so let's start writing some logic let's start with create a player all right there we go create player it's gonna take a name string equals that all right how about create game let's see create game all right there we go interesting create player yup yup yup all right let's save it get that sweet auto import going now we've created the player we've created the game what's the last thing what's the next thing we need to do ah we need to do something we need to read from the input uh read input now remember we've specified it as ooh read input okay okay i like where this is going var input int okay printf enter your guess yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah okay perfect all right so that's pretty much the entirety of the games like required logic look at that i didn't write a single line of code all right so now we're gonna have to do the hardest part of this we're gonna need to create the game loop now can copilot do it here we go create game loop all right function game loop i like it i like it 4g player one guess does not equal player let's see okay so it's actually confused at what game we're playing we're playing here let's loop a forever all right uh read a player inputs there we go let's see check which player is uh guessed closer to the random number all right so it's a little confused it wants to see if it's exactly it so let's help it get a little bit closer let's try to do this p1 diff equals yeah that looks pretty good is there is there like a math dot absolute yeah there is a math.absolute that one there we go there we go yes that all right so let's do this again let's do p2 diff

there we go all right perfect if p1 diff is less than p do diff player one wins else if p1 diff is greater than player two diff player two wins else it's a tie oh my goodness that's pretty crazy right now let's see we should probably do a do you wish to continue part don't you think check if the player wants to play again i i didn't even plan this would you like to play again yes yeah this thing's the devil what's left ai thanks for playing

now ai's will steal your job in the future

okay so if you're watching this this should just blow your mind right this should genuinely blow your mind now for those of us who know how to program this was an incredible experience but we're not done we still need to write the main function so to write the main function we just i i just assume he doesn't go like this funk main let's see what happens here okay uh yeah create the game okay

oh my goodness okay let's oh oh my goodness all right so how do i play this thing all right so let's just run the game see what happens all right player one guess your number five player two guess your number five it's a tie yes 69 420 i am the best no thank you so much for watching i hope that you liked it hey leave some comments down below what did you think about that was that a little terrifying how quickly i was able to write a program in a language in which i do not have a huge amount of proficiency in able to create structs methods hanging off of structures instantiation game loops forever loops right like those are a lot of things i would just simply have to go look up i wouldn't know they could just do a four with a squirrely brace i wouldn't know a lot of that but it just worked if you didn't catch it we actually did a whole thing live on twitch i'm gonna do a few more of these on twitch it is pretty fun to play with unfortunately i have to use vs code which is just like a death sentence for me but we'll do it we'll get through it together
