### YADM
* repo, in the shape of your dotfiles, and it will install them for you
![YADM HomePage](./images/yadm.png)

```
yadm clone git@github.com:ThePrimeagen/dotfiles
yadm add .config/nvim/plugins/lsp.vim
```

<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

### So what should I do?
#### YADM vs Stow
##### Don't forget dotbot

### My summary

As far as I can see YADM doesn't have a spot for me.  Its simplier than
ansible, but it doesn't provide the installation.  Its more complex than stow,
but it doesn't provide simplicity and the separation of concerns.
