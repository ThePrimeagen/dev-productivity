### What is the problem we are solving?
ask this everytime.

<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

1.  We want to configure the programs we love with our personal touch.
2.  We want to be able to keep track and commit our changes over time.
3.  I would prefer it to be any os compatible

<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

#### Who here knows anything about dotfiles?

<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

### Example of dotfiles
lets do a little example

```
set tabstop=4 softtabstop=4
set shiftwidth=4
set expandtab
set smartindent
```

<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

### There are three solutions that seem to popular
* yadm
* GNU/stow
* dotbot

<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

### So lets talk about stow
So I think stow is amazing.
* Its very simple
* It only manages symlinks
* Which allows it to be OS and version-able

<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

### To install and follow along
```
sudo apt install stow
```

```
brew install stow
```

<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

### lets do some very basic examples

* Stow'ing.  Some terminology
* Stow'ing our first file.
* Stow'ing our first directory.
* Stow'ing our two directories with similar paths
* UN-Stow'ing
* Stow'ing issues

<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

### So now that you know.
I just have to know.  How many tingles are you feeling?  I am feeling all of
them.

* Or does it just feel complicated?  Well lets work through the Ansible
  together!

<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

### I bet you want to talk about vim
I can tell.  You are eager.
