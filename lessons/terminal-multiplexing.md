### What do I use?
xterm
* meat and poe - tay - toes <br />

tmux
* This separates the terminal you are using from the underlying session/shell running.

### A little story about me
And my love of the terminal.<br/>
<br/>

Like any good story... it didn't start that way.

### I wont be recommending a terminal emulator today

I use xterm.  It was developed in 1984.

### So what are we going to talk about?
I am going to talk about multiplexing your terminal to cure your terminal
overloading woes.  We will eventually build a tool around it and live that
harpoon lifestyle.
