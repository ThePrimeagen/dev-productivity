### What is the terminal vs shell
* Terminal - psuedo-terminal.  Something that does the reads and the writes.
* Shell - The command line interpreter.  This does the actual program starting
          and interpretation of the command line language (zsh for example)

<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

### What do I use?
xterm
* meat and poe - tay - toes <br />

tmux
* This separates the terminal you are using from the shell that is running. <br />
